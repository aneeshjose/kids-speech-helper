# kids-speech-helper
App to help small children to learn numbers and alphabets. 

The app starts with a number verification such that the app should only be opened by elders.
It is currently having two sections alphabets and numbers. Alphabets A-Z and Numbers 1-20.

The project uses flutter_tts, speech_recognition, and permission handler.

The speech recognition is not that accurate. But useful in identifying the voice is of human. 
Upon recognition of the voice, the app speaks the next letter/number and waits for user input.
